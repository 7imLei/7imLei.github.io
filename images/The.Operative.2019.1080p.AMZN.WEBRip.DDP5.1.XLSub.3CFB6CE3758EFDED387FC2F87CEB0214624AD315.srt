1
00:02:49,343 --> 00:02:50,387
哈囉?

2
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:51,736
我父親...

3
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,521
又死了.

4
00:03:07,926 --> 00:03:10,842
- 大使館你好.
- 存取密碼 2-2...

5
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:13,280
密碼是 2-2-4-5-4.
還有效嗎?

6
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:17,197
有.

7
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,415
我需要追蹤一通電話

8
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:20,243
一分鐘前打給我的.

9
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:21,723
好.

10
00:03:32,342 --> 00:03:34,431
哈囉?

11
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:36,172
她剛打電話給你.

12
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,826
我不知道發生了什麼事.

13
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:39,412
我們需要你現在來特拉維夫一趟.

14
00:03:39,436 --> 00:03:41,240
你他媽的開什麼玩笑?
到底發生了什麼事.

15
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:43,353
不要透過電話.
你得搭飛機過來.

16
00:03:43,397 --> 00:03:45,268
不, 不, 那...
那是不可能的.

17
00:03:45,312 --> 00:03:46,443
我在這裡跟你見面.

18
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:50,665
湯瑪士, it's 喬.

19
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,275
Jesus!
They brought you in?

20
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,450
They did.

21
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,714
How are you, 喬? How's Netta?

22
00:03:56,758 --> 00:03:58,977
She's fine.
Still in remission.

23
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:00,849
Listen, 湯瑪士,
the situation is getting...

24
00:04:00,892 --> 00:04:02,372
I'm not flying anywhere, 喬.

25
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,896
You don't have to fly anywhere.

26
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:05,288
There's a safe house in 科隆.

27
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:06,483
They'll give you the details.

28
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:07,508
I'm heading there now.

29
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:10,530
Thanks for coming
on such a short notice.

30
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:11,816
- I'm Daniel.
- 湯瑪士.

31
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:26,527
- Hi.
- Hi.

32
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:30,052
I remember.

33
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,978
Why did she call you?

34
00:04:43,021 --> 00:04:44,240
I don't know.

35
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,502
Why did she call you?

36
00:04:45,546 --> 00:04:46,914
- She knows you're out?
- I don't know.

37
00:04:46,938 --> 00:04:48,462
Are you gonna tell me
what's going on?

38
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:55,338
She said, "My father died.
Again." And hung up.

39
00:04:57,906 --> 00:04:59,560
What does it mean?

40
00:04:59,603 --> 00:05:01,605
"Her father dying"
was her pullout code from Iran.

41
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:02,867
Did her father really die?

42
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,745
Her father died four days ago,
near 倫敦.

43
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:13,400
She slipped out of 以色列,
attended his funeral,

44
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:14,966
and disappeared
right after that.

45
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,098
Disappeared?

46
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:19,971
She could be anywhere now.

47
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:26,891
I'm only talking to 喬.

48
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:30,678
I'm only talking to 喬.

49
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:31,959
- He's on his way.
- He's retired.

50
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:33,221
Yeah, so am I. For fuck's sake,

51
00:05:33,245 --> 00:05:35,378
you had him call me,
I'm only talking to him.

52
00:05:56,312 --> 00:05:57,357
Whatever, 湯瑪士.

53
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,749
Are you pulling me out?

54
00:05:58,793 --> 00:05:59,837
No.

55
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:04,886
Are you pulling me out?

56
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:05,930
No.

57
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:10,041
You always wanted
to get your hands on him.

58
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:11,390
But you got your hands on him.

59
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:14,199
- See how that worked out.
- Fuck you.

60
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:21,555
Isn't it nice to be needed?

61
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:23,663
I've been waiting for this call
ever since you graduated.

62
00:06:23,687 --> 00:06:25,472
- Hey, watch out.
- You can have this room.

63
00:06:25,515 --> 00:06:26,797
Anything you need,
we will be right here.

64
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:27,865
Mm-hm.

65
00:06:33,218 --> 00:06:34,544
Listen, until the call
this morning,

66
00:06:34,568 --> 00:06:36,308
I hadn't heard from her
in over a year.

67
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:38,398
湯瑪士, nobody is blaming you
for anything.

68
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:41,009
This is about assessing
her motives.

69
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:42,445
You were the person
closest to her.

70
00:06:42,489 --> 00:06:44,273
You're crucial.

71
00:06:44,316 --> 00:06:46,449
Look, let's just go over this,
step by step.

72
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:48,190
Let them do the grunt work.

73
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:50,410
We need to get into her head.

74
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:52,368
We have an advantage over them.

75
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,109
You know her and I know you.

76
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,022
Do you consider yourself Jewish?

77
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,428
My father was half Jewish.

78
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:10,473
I read in your file
that you were adopted.

79
00:07:10,517 --> 00:07:12,823
Is that relevant?

80
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:15,260
Do you know who
your biological parents were?

81
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:17,175
Mm-mm.

82
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:19,090
Were you brought up Christian
by your mother?

83
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:22,050
To some extent.

84
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:24,531
We should develop that.

85
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:28,056
When they assigned her to me,

86
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:31,276
she was working out of 萊比錫, doing basic stuff.

87
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,583
It was my idea
to send her to 德黑蘭,

88
00:07:33,627 --> 00:07:34,908
get her into
the nuclear division.

89
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:37,694
It wasn't easy
to convince HQ.

90
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:39,676
She did have
a very unusual biography

91
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,982
for a Mossad operative.

92
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:42,070
Born in 倫敦.

93
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:43,637
Her father, a British citizen.

94
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,030
Her mother, German,
基督徒浸信會,

95
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:48,903
who died when 瑞秋 was 12.

96
00:07:48,946 --> 00:07:50,687
I don't remember much
of 倫敦.

97
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:52,950
What I think I remember

98
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:55,387
is probably
from pictures I saw later.

99
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:57,041
We moved to Boston
when I was six,

100
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:58,608
加拿大 when I was twelve.

101
00:07:58,652 --> 00:08:00,218
That's when my mom
started chemo.

102
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,047
So where are you from?

103
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,576
Only place
I've ever felt at home,

104
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:11,665
at least for a moment,
is 以色列.

105
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:14,276
Why?

106
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,626
I don't know.

107
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,063
You know, my mom
always used to talk about it.

108
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:22,023
She volunteered
in a kibbutz there in the '70s.

109
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:24,373
It was a big thing for Germans
to do at that time.

110
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:27,463
Have you ever lived there?

111
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:33,730
She was in a relationship

112
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:35,795
with an 以色列i medical student she'd met in 倫敦.

113
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:37,517
That was her first time
in the country.

114
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,170
When they split up, she stayed.

115
00:08:39,214 --> 00:08:42,565
She had no real plans. She was kind of a drifter.

116
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:44,175
When she extended her work visa,

117
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,134
someone
in the organization noticed.

118
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:48,223
I mean, she immediately
attracted attention,

119
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:49,354
passports,

120
00:08:49,398 --> 00:08:50,878
language skills.

121
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:53,054
A lack of any center
or real roots anywhere.

122
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,598
The recruiter got a sense

123
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:57,711
that she was eager to belong.

124
00:08:57,754 --> 00:09:00,844
Eager to do
something significant.

125
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:05,327
We gave her
a fully authenticated

126
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,850
Australian passport.

127
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:08,939
Built her a whole new identity
around that.

128
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:11,463
Early years near 雪梨,
growing up in 加拿大.

129
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:14,641
She spent a year in 萊比錫
establishing that identity.

130
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:16,904
Her cover,

131
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:19,036
an English and French teacher.

132
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,690
哈囉.

133
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,881
Her first assignment

134
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:39,709
was to get a work permit
in 德黑蘭,

135
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:42,451
sponsored by
a local language school there.

136
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:45,019
For a Mossad operative
to enter Iran so early

137
00:09:45,062 --> 00:09:46,542
in their career is unusual,

138
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,413
but I had confidence in her.

139
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:00,948
This making you uncomfortable?

140
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:01,992
Mm-mm.

141
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:07,911
Primary screening
is about 30 seconds.

142
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:10,131
If you got a secondary,
that's hours.

143
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:13,264
A secondary can be triggered
by nervousness

144
00:10:13,308 --> 00:10:14,918
or any kind of inconsistency.

145
00:10:14,962 --> 00:10:17,965
So luggage, length of stay,
profession, ticket class,

146
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:19,531
they all have to match.

147
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:21,229
You shouldn't look like

148
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:23,318
you've just stepped out
of a mall.

149
00:10:24,928 --> 00:10:26,538
How close are you
to your father?

150
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:31,282
Why? What do you mean?

151
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:32,719
You should always
establish cover

152
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:34,982
with close family members
before unusual absences.

153
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:40,552
Oh, we're not close.

154
00:10:40,596 --> 00:10:41,597
Still.

155
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:48,212
What?

156
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:50,301
All right.

157
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:51,433
I'll do it, fine.

158
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,482
You live alone, don't you?

159
00:10:57,526 --> 00:10:58,745
Do I?

160
00:10:58,788 --> 00:11:00,703
Hmm, I don't know.

161
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:03,358
You always schedule meetings
on weekends.

162
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:05,795
Your predecessor never did.

163
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,362
Well, I think
if it is 24-7 for you,

164
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:08,624
then it should be for me, too.

165
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,629
So even if you were married,
you'd see me on a weekend?

166
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:24,684
I'm probably
not gonna sleep tonight.

167
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:26,598
You're gonna do great.

168
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,515
You're the best person
for this assignment.

169
00:11:31,952 --> 00:11:33,344
Thank you for saying that.

170
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,492
- 哈囉.
- 哈囉.

171
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:42,500
Know anybody in 德黑蘭?

172
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:44,198
No, uh...

173
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:46,635
I e-mailed with the person
who hired me.

174
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,553
You are staying where?

175
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:52,772
Hotel Esteghlal.

176
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:06,394
Hey!

177
00:13:23,628 --> 00:13:24,716
I'm sorry?

178
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,283
New?

179
00:13:26,327 --> 00:13:29,112
Oh, some. I lost my luggage
on my flight to Berlin.

180
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:53,658
Taxi!

181
00:15:21,398 --> 00:15:22,573
哈囉?

182
00:15:22,617 --> 00:15:23,966
哈囉, Miss Currin.

183
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,882
Our spa is open
and at your disposal.

184
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,710
We also want to let you know

185
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:30,538
that we have
all kinds of drinks.

186
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:32,366
Not just what's in the menu,

187
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:33,976
all kinds of drinks.

188
00:16:28,944 --> 00:16:31,338
I couldn't sleep that night.

189
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:34,689
I imagined them entering,
dragging me out.

190
00:16:34,732 --> 00:16:37,257
I imagined being hanged.

191
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,911
I remember thinking,
I'm all alone.

192
00:16:39,955 --> 00:16:41,870
You know, it's just me

193
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:43,654
and the rest of the world.

194
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:45,047
Everybody must know who I am.

195
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:46,179
How could they not?

196
00:16:47,658 --> 00:16:48,746
And then I realized,

197
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,879
as I was standing there,
peeping, that...

198
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,926
I had nothing to hide.

199
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,364
You know I was just that person
who came here to teach.

200
00:16:57,407 --> 00:16:58,452
That's it.

201
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:00,105
Nothing else.

202
00:17:01,498 --> 00:17:03,935
I just decided
I wasn't gonna be afraid.

203
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,200
That's a temporary work permit.

204
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,384
Okay, file all your receipts,
I'll handle the reports.

205
00:17:17,427 --> 00:17:18,820
Take a couple of days off.

206
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:21,257
You did good.

207
00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:22,302
Okay.

208
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:27,611
What's that perfume?

209
00:17:29,352 --> 00:17:30,440
What do you mean?

210
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:31,724
It's not the one you left with.

211
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:55,683
Was it clear at this point

212
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:57,226
that she was going to go
long-term to Iran?

213
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,686
No.

214
00:17:58,729 --> 00:18:00,011
She made some contacts there

215
00:18:00,035 --> 00:18:03,125
and was liked
at the language school.

216
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:07,303
But I needed her to be part of
one of the big operations first.

217
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:10,132
I needed the higher-ups to pay attention to her.

218
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:13,135
安潔拉, this is 史蒂芬.
史蒂芬, 安潔拉.

219
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:15,006
Staying one night
in uusseldorf,

220
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,139
for shopping
and waiting for a flight.

221
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:19,010
Your room number is 507.

222
00:18:19,054 --> 00:18:21,317
Already checked in.

223
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:22,710
You really don't speak
any Hebrew?

224
00:18:22,753 --> 00:18:23,798
What's it to you?

225
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:28,455
史蒂芬 is really lousy
at cover work.

226
00:18:28,498 --> 00:18:29,867
So don't let him open his mouth.

227
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:31,893
Security cameras
and the layout

228
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:34,330
is here, here, here, and there.

229
00:18:34,374 --> 00:18:37,377
This is a time table
when we can access them.

230
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,769
- And the lobby,
- Here?

231
00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:40,771
if you sit here,
you have the best view.

232
00:18:47,648 --> 00:18:49,582
How long are we supposed to stay at the bar?

233
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:50,651
That's your call.

234
00:18:50,694 --> 00:18:51,802
Just long enough
for people there

235
00:18:51,826 --> 00:18:53,610
to get a sense of your presence.

236
00:18:53,654 --> 00:18:55,351
Aren't we supposed to talk?

237
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,180
Even a little?

238
00:18:58,224 --> 00:18:59,529
This is Anton ooska.

239
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:01,792
He's been helping Iran
since the '90s.

240
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:03,490
Uranium enrichment program.

241
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:05,492
That's the only photo
we have of him.

242
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:07,407
It was probably taken
15 years ago.

243
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,539
Positive ID is crucial.

244
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,821
If he's in the bar tonight,

245
00:19:10,845 --> 00:19:12,412
you will be closest to him.

246
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:14,196
There'll be another team
cross-validating

247
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,416
with telephoto lenses.

248
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:18,026
How was your practice?

249
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:19,636
It was good.

250
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,465
Uh, when I went to this corner,
people usually stood here.

251
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:24,293
I could easily squeeze
in between them

252
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:25,773
to get to the panel.

253
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:27,818
And I wasn't even pregnant then.

254
00:19:27,862 --> 00:19:30,517
So elevators A, B, C, D.

255
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,345
Text 史蒂芬
before you get in

256
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:33,988
to let him know
which elevator you're in.

257
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:41,919
What if you need
to let 史蒂芬 know

258
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:43,486
for any reason to abort?

259
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:46,185
If I have to abort I say,
"Here you are."

260
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:48,143
I exit to the right
in front of him.

261
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,492
I take him away.

262
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:50,991
He's my husband,
he was waiting for me.

263
00:19:51,015 --> 00:19:53,583
All goes well,
I exit to the left,

264
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:54,671
get out of his shot.

265
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:59,546
Now, we don't execute
at any cost.

266
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:00,982
Something
is not according to plan,

267
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:02,418
you have the right
to call it off.

268
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:05,116
Exit?

269
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,640
Emergency stairs.

270
00:20:06,683 --> 00:20:08,946
We wait here and pickup is here.

271
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,034
Right.

272
00:21:06,003 --> 00:21:07,135
Miss, we're going up.

273
00:21:07,178 --> 00:21:08,373
- We're going up.
- Oh. Oh, up.

274
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:10,181
Uh, no matter,
I take a tour with you.

275
00:21:15,056 --> 00:21:17,928
Uh, sorry.
Um, can you press L, please?

276
00:21:17,972 --> 00:21:18,973
Thank you.

277
00:21:34,771 --> 00:21:36,382
There you are.

278
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:45,129
No, please!

279
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,822
哈囉.

280
00:23:08,865 --> 00:23:10,606
I'm 瑞秋.

281
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,781
Rosita.

282
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:13,261
Hi.

283
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:21,138
Hey!

284
00:23:21,182 --> 00:23:22,226
- Hi.
- Pleasure.

285
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,550
I wanted to meet you
for a while.

286
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:24,751
- I'm Ronnie.
- Pleasure.

287
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:26,394
We actually met before,
once in training.

288
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:28,711
This is Dan.

289
00:23:28,755 --> 00:23:30,036
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

290
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,236
No chance you met him before.

291
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,239
Beautiful day.

292
00:23:35,283 --> 00:23:37,285
I missed the 以色列i weather.

293
00:23:49,602 --> 00:23:51,038
It's really nice to meet you.

294
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:56,435
You haven't been to 以色列
since you worked with him.

295
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:59,046
Oh, I work out of Germany.

296
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:00,569
You didn't even visit.

297
00:24:03,137 --> 00:24:04,486
You should visit more

298
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,662
to connect to the place,
to the people.

299
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:11,711
You're one of us now.

300
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:34,037
There aren't that
many foreigners there,

301
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:36,605
so everybody's constantly trying
to help you.

302
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:38,738
Prove that Iranians

303
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:41,218
are not like what
Westerners imagine them to be.

304
00:24:41,262 --> 00:24:42,437
They can be nice

305
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,701
to the point
of driving you crazy.

306
00:24:45,745 --> 00:24:48,095
Did it make it more difficult
for you to live your cover?

307
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:50,140
Not really.

308
00:24:50,184 --> 00:24:52,621
Um, just have to learn
how to handle it.

309
00:24:52,665 --> 00:24:54,754
Focus on the job,
the students.

310
00:24:55,363 --> 00:24:56,625
Be who you are.

311
00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:58,540
Hmm.

312
00:24:58,584 --> 00:25:00,803
You're very talented.

313
00:25:00,847 --> 00:25:03,763
It's not easy to stand out
in our organization.

314
00:25:05,155 --> 00:25:06,200
How do you feel about

315
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:08,158
a long-term assignment
in 德黑蘭?

316
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,577
Yeah, he just wanted
to look you in eye

317
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:16,645
when he asked you.

318
00:25:16,689 --> 00:25:18,647
Danke.

319
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:20,388
Didn't even know your name
till recently.

320
00:25:21,824 --> 00:25:23,652
Would you stay on as my handler?

321
00:25:23,696 --> 00:25:24,697
Of course.

322
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:28,701
So did you give them
an answer yet?

323
00:25:28,744 --> 00:25:30,616
I was so excited
I couldn't speak.

324
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:34,315
I can't believe I'm here.

325
00:25:38,754 --> 00:25:39,755
"Here"?

326
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,150
Doing this, you know.

327
00:25:52,768 --> 00:25:54,248
It does feel different

328
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:55,945
knowing that you're there
for a long time.

329
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,340
Now, I walk around a lot.

330
00:25:59,383 --> 00:26:00,776
I feel like that's important,

331
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,431
you know,
to get a sense of the city.

332
00:26:03,474 --> 00:26:05,868
Where things are.
How to interact with people.

333
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,176
How not to attract attention.

334
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:10,917
Keep to myself.

335
00:26:17,053 --> 00:26:18,683
I'm consciously making an effort

336
00:26:18,707 --> 00:26:20,970
to learn everyday habits here.

337
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:22,015
It's getting easier.

338
00:26:29,283 --> 00:26:30,913
The apartment
I rented in Pasdaran

339
00:26:30,937 --> 00:26:32,199
is, is perfect.

340
00:26:32,242 --> 00:26:33,679
It's practical. I like it.

341
00:26:33,722 --> 00:26:35,419
It's comfortable.

342
00:26:35,463 --> 00:26:37,903
Makes perfect sense for a single Western woman to live there.

343
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:43,819
There's lots of cafes
I like to sit in.

344
00:26:43,863 --> 00:26:45,386
Shops I like to shop in.

345
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:49,999
You know, the more

346
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:51,522
I have people around me,

347
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:52,654
I feel like I belong.

348
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:54,134
瑞秋.

349
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:58,268
Mahshid wanted
to ask you something.

350
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:02,577
She wanted to know

351
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,405
if you'd have come
dinner with us.

352
00:27:05,406 --> 00:27:07,582
I'd love to. Thank you.

353
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,844
I do like it there.

354
00:27:08,888 --> 00:27:10,019
I like 德黑蘭.

355
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:13,414
I'm alone
most of the time, but...

356
00:27:13,457 --> 00:27:15,590
You know I don't feel lonely.

357
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,809
I can't explain it.

358
00:27:22,162 --> 00:27:24,183
Every time I come back to Germany to see you,

359
00:27:24,207 --> 00:27:26,645
I feel more
and more out of place.

360
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:28,516
And I can't wait
to get back to Iran.

361
00:27:29,778 --> 00:27:31,040
Pants.

362
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:32,172
- "Pants."
- Mm-hmm.

363
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,611
It did feel very boring at first

364
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,613
after all the work
we've done here.

365
00:27:39,353 --> 00:27:40,615
But, um...

366
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,487
You know, my work is so detailed
and fragmented.

367
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:44,987
After a while,
I really realized

368
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:47,753
that it helps me focus
and occupies my mind.

369
00:28:33,624 --> 00:28:34,713
Thank you.

370
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,674
I'm an English teacher.

371
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,241
Is it okay if I work here?

372
00:28:41,284 --> 00:28:42,590
I like to get out of the house.

373
00:28:42,633 --> 00:28:43,765
Sure, no problem.

374
00:29:05,526 --> 00:29:06,832
Look at this.

375
00:29:07,571 --> 00:29:08,834
It's weeks

376
00:29:08,877 --> 00:29:11,793
of tracking the coming and going
of Reza Vahidi.

377
00:29:11,837 --> 00:29:14,013
- The Minister of Defense.
- Yeah.

378
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:15,144
Did she know that? Did...

379
00:29:15,188 --> 00:29:17,146
Did she know
who she was tracking?

380
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,365
She had no idea.

381
00:29:20,584 --> 00:29:21,977
After six months carrying out

382
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:23,979
small, disconnected missions
like this,

383
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:26,112
I felt that her routines
were set.

384
00:29:26,155 --> 00:29:29,332
That her cover was stable.
That she was stable.

385
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:30,986
She was ready
for the next thing.

386
00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:35,904
That's when we decided to approach Razavi Electronics.

387
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:37,819
Farhad Razavi.

388
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:40,648
"The wallet...

389
00:29:40,691 --> 00:29:42,519
- is gone."
- Is.

390
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:44,695
"Three coins...

391
00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:47,263
- Are.
- ...are missing."

392
00:29:47,307 --> 00:29:48,699
"Everyone...

393
00:29:48,743 --> 00:29:50,025
- Are...
- Is.

394
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:52,616
- ...is here."
- But "everyone" are many people.

395
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,229
Hey, hey, hey.

396
00:29:56,272 --> 00:29:58,492
It's actually
a really good question, Shirin.

397
00:29:58,535 --> 00:30:01,451
Does anybody know
why it's "is" and not "are"?

398
00:30:01,495 --> 00:30:02,888
- Ali?
- Mm?

399
00:30:03,758 --> 00:30:04,759
You know?

400
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:31,568
Come with me.

401
00:30:31,612 --> 00:30:34,093
My Uncle Farhad, he has a BMW.

402
00:30:34,136 --> 00:30:36,138
- Wow, really?
- Mm-hm.

403
00:30:36,965 --> 00:30:38,488
All right, well.

404
00:30:38,532 --> 00:30:40,229
Let's see who gets
to spot him first.

405
00:30:40,273 --> 00:30:41,274
Okay.

406
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:45,626
瑞秋?

407
00:30:56,115 --> 00:30:57,290
There he is.

408
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:58,334
Well.

409
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:03,513
- Goodbye!
- Bye, Ali!

410
00:31:05,298 --> 00:31:06,952
I am sorry I am late.

411
00:31:06,995 --> 00:31:08,997
My sister,
she called me just now.

412
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:11,043
No problem.

413
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:12,740
You've worked with Ali
after school?

414
00:31:13,697 --> 00:31:15,699
Yeah, twice a week.

415
00:31:15,743 --> 00:31:18,093
You give
the one-to-one lesson, too?

416
00:31:19,268 --> 00:31:20,922
One-on-one lessons, yeah.

417
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:22,358
Wait, wait.

418
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:34,588
My name is Farhad.

419
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:36,677
I'm 瑞秋. Nice to meet you.

420
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,940
I need your help.

421
00:31:38,984 --> 00:31:40,420
I think your English
is pretty good.

422
00:31:40,463 --> 00:31:41,508
No, I, uh...

423
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:42,857
I've worked in Europe a lot.

424
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,032
I want to...

425
00:31:44,076 --> 00:31:45,251
I want to be loose.

426
00:31:45,294 --> 00:31:46,861
You know, free.

427
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,558
You want to be "loose"?

428
00:31:48,602 --> 00:31:49,603
Uh...

429
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:51,387
You see?

430
00:31:53,824 --> 00:31:56,958
I'm going to drop Ali
to my sister's now.

431
00:31:57,002 --> 00:32:00,179
Uh, maybe
you can give me lesson later?

432
00:32:00,222 --> 00:32:02,790
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm really busy here today.

433
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:03,878
Ah.

434
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:04,923
Tomorrow?

435
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:20,808
Shall we begin?

436
00:32:23,332 --> 00:32:24,768
Tell me about yourself.

437
00:32:24,812 --> 00:32:27,771
No, no, no, uh...
I pay, I decide what we talk.

438
00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:33,560
"I'm paying, I should decide
what we talk about."

439
00:32:33,603 --> 00:32:35,170
Uh...

440
00:32:35,214 --> 00:32:36,365
If you're going to be impolite,

441
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:38,434
at least express
yourself correctly.

442
00:32:38,478 --> 00:32:39,870
Okay.

443
00:32:39,914 --> 00:32:41,394
Okay.

444
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:44,701
I'm paying, so I should decide
what we talk about.

445
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:47,007
Very good.

446
00:32:52,753 --> 00:32:54,189
- Oh, yes, please. Thank you.
- Yes.

447
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:56,931
What do you do?

448
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,890
It'll help me to find out
what your needs are.

449
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:01,718
You are in Iran, how long?

450
00:33:01,762 --> 00:33:03,416
A while.

451
00:33:03,459 --> 00:33:05,896
You did not learn not to ask
questions like that?

452
00:33:07,594 --> 00:33:10,379
"Haven't you learned
not to ask questions like that?"

453
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,384
"Haven't you learned
not to ask questions like that?"

454
00:33:15,428 --> 00:33:16,995
What do you wanna talk about?

455
00:33:18,474 --> 00:33:19,998
Tell me about yourself.

456
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,825
That's okay?

457
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:23,044
- Mm-hm.
- Really?

458
00:33:23,088 --> 00:33:24,674
You just make up the rules
that suit you?

459
00:33:24,698 --> 00:33:25,873
I'm so sorry.

460
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:27,875
The rules here are invented
to suit me.

461
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,009
So...

462
00:33:31,835 --> 00:33:33,663
Tell me something.

463
00:33:33,707 --> 00:33:35,187
Something personal.

464
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,840
Personal, um...

465
00:33:39,756 --> 00:33:40,931
I was adopted.

466
00:33:43,282 --> 00:33:45,762
My parents
are not my biological parents.

467
00:33:45,806 --> 00:33:47,068
You're born where?

468
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:48,765
I was born in Australia.

469
00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:50,811
But we left
when I was young.

470
00:33:50,854 --> 00:33:52,117
Six.

471
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,075
I grew up in Vancouver.

472
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,337
You are lucky.

473
00:33:57,644 --> 00:33:59,602
You lived in different places.

474
00:33:59,646 --> 00:34:02,388
Yeah, well, you know...

475
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:04,694
I'm jealous of people
that have a home.

476
00:34:04,738 --> 00:34:05,826
Place.

477
00:34:05,869 --> 00:34:07,393
Friends they know
since childhood.

478
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:09,612
So why are you here?

479
00:34:09,656 --> 00:34:11,136
I was teaching in 萊比錫.

480
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:13,703
But honestly, it was really,
really boring and...

481
00:34:14,965 --> 00:34:16,010
I don't know.

482
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,794
You know?

483
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:19,970
德黑蘭, there's something
I really like here.

484
00:34:20,797 --> 00:34:22,277
Hmm.

485
00:34:22,321 --> 00:34:24,714
You know what it is?

486
00:34:24,758 --> 00:34:27,543
The people here
all have many secrets.

487
00:34:28,327 --> 00:34:29,763
Do they?

488
00:34:29,806 --> 00:34:31,765
There's too many rules in Iran.

489
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,896
So...

490
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,290
If, uh... If you want to drink,

491
00:34:35,334 --> 00:34:36,900
you keep it secret.

492
00:34:36,944 --> 00:34:39,555
You marry a woman who is a...

493
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,601
You understand.
She, she had sex.

494
00:34:41,644 --> 00:34:43,385
You keep it secret.

495
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:44,821
If you go to a party

496
00:34:44,865 --> 00:34:46,780
or a cultural thing
too controversial,

497
00:34:46,823 --> 00:34:48,173
keep it secret.

498
00:34:48,216 --> 00:34:50,305
You don't want to fast
during Ramadan?

499
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:52,394
Eat in secret.

500
00:34:52,438 --> 00:34:54,353
It's the way of life here.

501
00:34:54,396 --> 00:34:55,484
Like a second nature.

502
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:44,968
瑞秋?

503
00:35:45,012 --> 00:35:46,144
Hi.

504
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:48,494
I wanted to see if, um...

505
00:35:48,537 --> 00:35:49,582
Do you wanna have tea?

506
00:35:56,284 --> 00:35:57,546
Are you okay?

507
00:35:59,331 --> 00:36:00,941
Oh, yes. I'm sorry.

508
00:36:00,984 --> 00:36:03,770
I'm just a bit dizzy.
It's the weather.

509
00:36:03,813 --> 00:36:05,119
Always happens to me.

510
00:36:11,865 --> 00:36:13,649
It's the man from the upstairs.

511
00:36:13,693 --> 00:36:15,129
His son is a criminal.

512
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,044
He often comes here to hide.

513
00:36:58,259 --> 00:36:59,608
哈囉?

514
00:36:59,652 --> 00:37:00,957
There's a party tonight.

515
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:02,437
Like the one I told you of.

516
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:04,309
Will you come?

517
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,746
Just like that, huh?

518
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:08,313
I will pick you up.

519
00:37:08,356 --> 00:37:09,792
My friends want to meet you.

520
00:37:17,974 --> 00:37:19,759
I didn't know
I could dress like that.

521
00:37:20,716 --> 00:37:21,761
Hey!

522
00:37:29,595 --> 00:37:30,659
This is my friend 瑞秋.

523
00:37:30,683 --> 00:37:31,988
瑞秋, this is Aarmeen.

524
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,662
Nice to meet you.

525
00:37:35,905 --> 00:37:37,472
- This is Bita.
- Nice to meet you.

526
00:37:37,516 --> 00:37:38,560
Yeah.

527
00:37:41,389 --> 00:37:42,695
What?

528
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,177
These are my childhood friends,

529
00:37:47,221 --> 00:37:48,962
- Nawser and Zoya.
- Nice to meet you.

530
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:50,833
This is 瑞秋? Salaam.

531
00:37:50,877 --> 00:37:53,749
- Welcome.
- Nice to meet you.

532
00:38:00,495 --> 00:38:02,323
Oh, I don't want that.

533
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:04,412
- It's okay.
- It's no help, really.

534
00:38:04,456 --> 00:38:05,761
瑞秋.

535
00:38:05,805 --> 00:38:06,936
Everyone does.

536
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,069
- No, I'm, I'm good.
- Just one.

537
00:38:10,244 --> 00:38:11,898
If you insist, I'm leaving.

538
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,031
Okay.

539
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:18,296
Wow!

540
00:38:19,732 --> 00:38:21,560
Another one?

541
00:38:21,603 --> 00:38:24,214
It's my first time
having alcohol in Iran.

542
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:28,262
Drinking is illegal here, right?

543
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,134
Your ecstasy dealer
is also your alcohol dealer.

544
00:39:06,822 --> 00:39:09,347
Like this guy with the hat,
they dance.

545
00:39:10,217 --> 00:39:11,653
I'll go.

546
00:42:03,216 --> 00:42:04,260
Hey.

547
00:42:04,304 --> 00:42:05,435
Good morning.

548
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:11,311
Is this your brother?

549
00:42:13,879 --> 00:42:14,880
Mm-hm.

550
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:46,172
What do you care?

551
00:42:54,876 --> 00:42:57,139
Your father called the embassy.

552
00:42:57,183 --> 00:42:58,706
Started asking questions.

553
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,622
So I had to talk to him.

554
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:03,232
Explain everything.

555
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,758
You did what?

556
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,892
That's private, 湯瑪士,
all right?

557
00:43:10,936 --> 00:43:12,720
And that's none
of your goddamn business.

558
00:43:14,461 --> 00:43:16,071
He told me
you're not adopted.

559
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:26,125
That was just a game, 湯瑪士.

560
00:43:26,168 --> 00:43:27,953
A stupid game
I used to play as a teenager.

561
00:43:27,996 --> 00:43:29,215
It's nothing.

562
00:43:29,258 --> 00:43:30,898
You said in your file
that you're adopted.

563
00:43:32,392 --> 00:43:33,959
I didn't mean to lie.

564
00:43:34,002 --> 00:43:36,111
It's just something my friend
and I used to say in school.

565
00:43:36,135 --> 00:43:37,658
And I'm sure
it was written somewhere.

566
00:43:37,702 --> 00:43:38,790
So I just automatically...

567
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:40,792
So from a teenager till now,

568
00:43:40,835 --> 00:43:41,923
a grown woman,

569
00:43:43,098 --> 00:43:44,538
you are still saying
you are adopted?

570
00:43:44,578 --> 00:43:46,232
- So what?
- So what?

571
00:43:47,363 --> 00:43:49,061
You told me you're adopted.

572
00:43:49,104 --> 00:43:50,671
You basically
told this organization

573
00:43:50,715 --> 00:43:51,977
that you are adopted.

574
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,607
When I started working
for the Mossad,

575
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,502
all I did was...

576
00:43:55,545 --> 00:43:58,505
They just used my name
to rent apartments in Berlin.

577
00:43:58,548 --> 00:44:01,073
All right? I never imagined
it would go this far.

578
00:44:01,116 --> 00:44:02,465
It was just a stupid lie.

579
00:44:02,509 --> 00:44:03,704
That you're still telling now.

580
00:44:03,728 --> 00:44:05,294
- Yes.
- Why?

581
00:44:08,297 --> 00:44:09,951
I don't have anything else
to say to that.

582
00:44:09,995 --> 00:44:11,435
God, and you don't
even seem bothered

583
00:44:11,474 --> 00:44:13,215
that, one, you didn't inform

584
00:44:13,259 --> 00:44:15,043
family member
of your association with us,

585
00:44:15,087 --> 00:44:16,654
which you said you would do.

586
00:44:16,697 --> 00:44:18,544
And, two, you've lied about
something pretty major

587
00:44:18,568 --> 00:44:20,005
to do with your background.

588
00:44:20,048 --> 00:44:21,286
Now, this job is all about

589
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:22,505
being able
to be completely honest

590
00:44:22,529 --> 00:44:24,183
with the people
you're supposed to trust.

591
00:44:24,226 --> 00:44:27,186
You can lie to the world,
but in here, you tell the truth.

592
00:44:27,229 --> 00:44:29,492
To this organization,
you tell the truth.

593
00:44:29,536 --> 00:44:31,581
And to me, you tell the truth.

594
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:32,863
'Cause even shitty,
little details like this,

595
00:44:32,887 --> 00:44:33,975
it all matters,

596
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:35,455
because I have to trust you.

597
00:44:35,498 --> 00:44:37,500
I have to completely trust you.

598
00:44:42,418 --> 00:44:43,593
You're right.

599
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,690
I'm sleeping with Farhad.

600
00:44:54,996 --> 00:44:56,041
You're what?

601
00:44:56,781 --> 00:44:57,999
I slept with him.

602
00:44:58,043 --> 00:44:59,784
I mean I'm still sleeping
with him, but...

603
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,570
You were just supposed
to tutor him!

604
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:06,138
You didn't report this.

605
00:45:06,181 --> 00:45:07,487
I'm reporting it now.

606
00:45:09,532 --> 00:45:10,969
That was a key moment.

607
00:45:11,012 --> 00:45:13,406
We suddenly realized
we couldn't control her fully.

608
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:14,842
And she wanted
to make that point.

609
00:45:14,886 --> 00:45:16,472
She was like,
"If I wanna sleep with the guy,

610
00:45:16,496 --> 00:45:18,082
I'll sleep with the guy."
She had a life there.

611
00:45:18,106 --> 00:45:19,064
So what do you do?

612
00:45:19,107 --> 00:45:20,543
You let her dictate like that?

613
00:45:20,587 --> 00:45:21,651
You tolerate a relationship

614
00:45:21,675 --> 00:45:23,372
you have absolutely
no handle on?

615
00:45:23,416 --> 00:45:24,856
Or you pull her out?
Lose everything?

616
00:45:26,114 --> 00:45:27,115
What do you do?

617
00:45:45,568 --> 00:45:46,613
Especially not with her.

618
00:45:46,656 --> 00:45:48,136
What do you mean "not with her"?

619
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,766
She was just supposed to give
the guy private lessons.

620
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,333
We all know
what she was supposed to do.

621
00:45:51,357 --> 00:45:52,508
The question is what...

622
00:46:00,192 --> 00:46:01,193
I'll handle it.

623
00:46:04,631 --> 00:46:06,261
Are they gonna start
doubting me?

624
00:46:06,285 --> 00:46:07,460
Of course not.

625
00:46:07,503 --> 00:46:08,853
They just don't like surprises.

626
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:18,471
You're so good
at giving away nothing.

627
00:46:18,514 --> 00:46:19,914
Did you bring him
to your apartment?

628
00:46:22,736 --> 00:46:25,086
No, we went to a party
and back to his place.

629
00:46:30,831 --> 00:46:32,180
So tell me something about him.

630
00:46:34,617 --> 00:46:36,402
He wears more cosmetics
than I do.

631
00:46:42,843 --> 00:46:44,236
Razavi Electronics

632
00:46:44,279 --> 00:46:46,804
was a legit company
when we started.

633
00:46:47,761 --> 00:46:49,023
Farhad Razavi,

634
00:46:49,067 --> 00:46:51,199
we took him for a lightweight,
a rich playboy.

635
00:46:51,243 --> 00:46:52,611
But we discovered
that when the Iranians

636
00:46:52,635 --> 00:46:54,420
try to buy
a restricted technology,

637
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:56,857
they like doing it
through legit companies.

638
00:46:56,901 --> 00:47:00,643
So we started steering a lot of offers towards Razavi.

639
00:47:16,398 --> 00:47:17,660
This was all part

640
00:47:17,704 --> 00:47:19,706
of operation
"Business as Usual."

641
00:47:19,749 --> 00:47:21,403
We were grooming
Razavi Electronics

642
00:47:21,447 --> 00:47:23,014
to become
an unwitting middleman

643
00:47:23,057 --> 00:47:25,886
between us and the Iranian Secret Service.

644
00:47:27,235 --> 00:47:28,976
For that,
we needed to infiltrate

645
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,760
their internal network.

646
00:47:30,804 --> 00:47:33,459
It's a pretty simple task given they were a civilian company.

647
00:47:35,417 --> 00:47:37,767
Oh, I'm sorry,
I got lost.

648
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:39,291
Do you know where the exit is?

649
00:47:39,334 --> 00:47:40,683
- It's there.
- Oh.

650
00:47:41,293 --> 00:47:42,294
Thank you.

651
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:43,991
So?

652
00:47:45,427 --> 00:47:46,646
Can you do this work?

653
00:47:47,473 --> 00:47:48,735
Is that you?

654
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:51,150
How old?

655
00:47:52,608 --> 00:47:54,132
How much do you want per hour?

656
00:47:57,744 --> 00:47:59,180
Call me a cab?

657
00:47:59,224 --> 00:48:00,703
I will drive you.

658
00:48:00,747 --> 00:48:01,966
Can you wait five minutes?

659
00:48:02,009 --> 00:48:04,533
I'll wait for you outside.
I need some air.

660
00:48:05,273 --> 00:48:06,492
Hey, uh...

661
00:48:07,362 --> 00:48:09,974
Are people looking at me?

662
00:48:10,017 --> 00:48:12,454
Is it okay for an unmarried man
and an unmarried woman

663
00:48:12,498 --> 00:48:14,195
to be seen together?

664
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:15,936
Please,
stop worrying about this.

665
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:16,937
Nobody cares.

666
00:48:16,981 --> 00:48:18,983
Okay.

667
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,391
That flag in your booth,

668
00:48:37,523 --> 00:48:38,741
is it Azerbaijan?

669
00:48:41,135 --> 00:48:42,354
You know the flag?

670
00:48:42,397 --> 00:48:44,008
Yeah.

671
00:48:44,051 --> 00:48:45,052
Never been there.

672
00:48:47,054 --> 00:48:48,273
Once, I lived there,

673
00:48:48,316 --> 00:48:49,578
for many years.

674
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,234
Can I try your brand?

675
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:54,932
It's strong.

676
00:48:58,283 --> 00:48:59,371
Thank you.

677
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,451
Shit.

678
00:49:36,495 --> 00:49:38,540
If he didn't give me so much...

679
00:49:38,584 --> 00:49:41,021
...I would have finished
my day 30 minutes before.

680
00:49:41,065 --> 00:49:42,283
I'm sorry.

681
00:49:42,327 --> 00:49:43,937
What's...

682
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,373
It's too much politeness,

683
00:49:45,417 --> 00:49:46,809
too much flattery.

684
00:49:46,853 --> 00:49:49,073
"How can I ever thank you?

685
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:51,031
I would never dream
to trouble you."

686
00:49:51,075 --> 00:49:53,425
Yeah, I've wasted
half my day on this.

687
00:50:25,587 --> 00:50:27,676
"How can I ever thank you?

688
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,635
I would never dream
to trouble you."

689
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:57,967
Are you here by yourself
all night?

690
00:51:03,016 --> 00:51:04,713
That is what I'm good for.

691
00:51:05,453 --> 00:51:06,715
Smoking and...

692
00:51:07,629 --> 00:51:09,153
letting the time pass.

693
00:51:10,937 --> 00:51:13,026
My mom always used to say...

694
00:51:13,896 --> 00:51:15,376
She died of cancer.

695
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,118
She always used to say
that we let time slip.

696
00:51:18,162 --> 00:51:19,902
You know, let it pass us by.

697
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:23,819
My brother, same thing.

698
00:51:23,863 --> 00:51:27,084
He is younger,
he is going to die soon.

699
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:29,390
And all he wants
is more time.

700
00:51:31,653 --> 00:51:33,046
And I have all the time.

701
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,134
Too much.

702
00:51:34,178 --> 00:51:35,178
I don't need it.

703
00:51:35,962 --> 00:51:38,138
Yeah, well...

704
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:39,681
A person who knows
they're about to die,

705
00:51:39,705 --> 00:51:41,663
that's the worst.

706
00:51:41,707 --> 00:51:43,578
Best to die like that.

707
00:51:44,666 --> 00:51:45,667
Yes.

708
00:51:49,584 --> 00:51:51,717
Why only have two guards?

709
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,546
You know, switch,
play backgammon...

710
00:51:54,589 --> 00:51:55,764
Money.

711
00:51:55,808 --> 00:51:56,809
Just me.

712
00:54:20,909 --> 00:54:22,911
Yes. Got it!

713
00:54:22,955 --> 00:54:24,826
Yes!

714
00:55:02,995 --> 00:55:03,996
Shit.

715
00:56:13,457 --> 00:56:14,458
Shit.

716
00:57:04,377 --> 00:57:05,987
Oh, Nima.

717
00:57:06,031 --> 00:57:07,815
You scared me.

718
00:57:07,859 --> 00:57:09,730
I got locked in the bathroom
after work today.

719
00:57:09,774 --> 00:57:11,384
Just got out.

720
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,125
I'm gonna tell Farhad
about it tomorrow.

721
00:57:13,168 --> 00:57:14,169
Have a good night.

722
00:57:25,006 --> 00:57:26,443
Shit!

723
00:58:14,578 --> 00:58:15,927
Asleep already?

724
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:19,191
Almost.

725
00:58:19,974 --> 00:58:21,759
Everything okay?

726
00:58:21,802 --> 00:58:23,242
Maybe you want
to come over?

727
00:58:24,544 --> 00:58:25,545
Um...

728
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:26,764
I'm tired, you know.

729
00:58:26,807 --> 00:58:28,132
I have that early
makeup class tomorrow.

730
00:58:29,418 --> 00:58:31,203
That fucking class you missed.

731
00:58:31,246 --> 00:58:32,857
How much time
must I hear about this?

732
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,119
See you tomorrow, okay?

733
00:58:35,729 --> 00:58:37,426
Yes, okay.

734
01:01:10,275 --> 01:01:12,103
I'm sorry.

735
01:01:42,481 --> 01:01:43,612
哈囉?

736
01:01:45,658 --> 01:01:47,007
Yeah, I'm working on it.

737
01:01:48,922 --> 01:01:50,924
I need a minute, Ronnie,
all right? Back off.

738
01:02:03,807 --> 01:02:05,447
You know,
they're waiting for us.

739
01:02:07,288 --> 01:02:09,160
You're trying to make
a fool of me?

740
01:02:09,203 --> 01:02:11,379
Maybe you are a fool.

741
01:02:11,423 --> 01:02:13,207
Maybe you all are.

742
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:14,252
Excuse me?

743
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,520
Why didn't anyone tell me

744
01:02:21,563 --> 01:02:23,870
that the system,
like any Windows system,

745
01:02:23,914 --> 01:02:26,307
might try an automatic update?

746
01:02:26,351 --> 01:02:28,005
You know,
I follow your protocols

747
01:02:28,048 --> 01:02:30,355
like a fucking robot
assuming you know everything.

748
01:02:30,398 --> 01:02:32,313
But you don't.

749
01:02:32,357 --> 01:02:34,794
I reviewed all the data
from SIGINT.

750
01:02:34,838 --> 01:02:36,883
Everyone is sure the guard OD'd.

751
01:02:36,927 --> 01:02:39,625
Police, Razavi Electronics,
everyone.

752
01:02:40,974 --> 01:02:42,497
That's not what I mean.

753
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:43,977
This is war.

754
01:02:44,021 --> 01:02:45,936
No, it's not like war.
It is war.

755
01:02:45,979 --> 01:02:47,894
And in war, innocent people die.

756
01:02:54,205 --> 01:02:55,249
Look.

757
01:02:55,293 --> 01:02:56,642
If we...

758
01:03:00,167 --> 01:03:02,474
If we were in that meeting,
you would understand

759
01:03:02,517 --> 01:03:04,258
the significance
of what you've done

760
01:03:04,302 --> 01:03:06,347
and how everyone appreciates it.

761
01:03:06,391 --> 01:03:07,827
I am really impressed

762
01:03:07,871 --> 01:03:11,135
by your ability to cope
with unexpected situations.

763
01:03:11,178 --> 01:03:13,746
That's the reason we're able
to let you be out there alone.

764
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:20,492
How's your Hebrew?

765
01:03:20,535 --> 01:03:22,015
What?

766
01:03:22,059 --> 01:03:24,757
It's shit.

767
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,368
They take the piss out of me
when I speak it, so I don't.

768
01:03:27,412 --> 01:03:28,979
Is that why
they assigned you to me?

769
01:03:30,067 --> 01:03:31,982
The outsiders?

770
01:03:32,025 --> 01:03:33,635
A British Jew
living in Germany.

771
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:35,463
Working for a country
that's not his.

772
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:48,955
How does someone with such
a tenuous connection to 以色列

773
01:03:48,999 --> 01:03:51,001
to the cause,
get to be at the heart

774
01:03:51,044 --> 01:03:52,326
of one of the most
sensitive operations?

775
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:54,482
Not tenuous. Not tenuous.

776
01:03:54,526 --> 01:03:55,875
Unusual.

777
01:03:55,919 --> 01:03:57,200
You're all doing
what they've been doing

778
01:03:57,224 --> 01:03:58,051
all along.

779
01:03:58,095 --> 01:03:59,226
Thinking of her a foreigner

780
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:01,272
that we can use
and not one of us.

781
01:04:01,315 --> 01:04:02,534
Am I?

782
01:04:02,577 --> 01:04:04,318
She didn't get
to a sensitive place.

783
01:04:04,362 --> 01:04:06,755
It became a sensitive place
because she was there.

784
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:08,801
We were selling
the Iranian Government

785
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,237
nuclear technology.

786
01:04:10,281 --> 01:04:11,412
Defective components.

787
01:04:11,456 --> 01:04:12,849
Components
with tracking devices.

788
01:04:12,892 --> 01:04:14,938
It became the
central arena because of her.

789
01:04:14,981 --> 01:04:17,505
Because of us.
Because of my work with her.

790
01:05:38,717 --> 01:05:40,893
Fuck.

791
01:05:47,595 --> 01:05:50,294
Remember when we were
at the party in Niavaran?

792
01:05:50,337 --> 01:05:51,643
When I was dancing,

793
01:05:51,686 --> 01:05:53,819
you were talking to this lady
in a gold dress.

794
01:05:55,342 --> 01:05:57,562
Do you know her?

795
01:05:57,605 --> 01:05:59,216
I wanted to ask her something.

796
01:05:59,259 --> 01:06:00,619
I don't know these people.

797
01:06:00,652 --> 01:06:02,132
You don't know them?

798
01:06:02,175 --> 01:06:03,220
You sure?

799
01:06:03,263 --> 01:06:05,439
Maybe they are friends
of Nawser's.

800
01:06:05,483 --> 01:06:08,486
I don't know.

801
01:06:15,754 --> 01:06:16,973
What are you asking?

802
01:06:17,016 --> 01:06:18,148
Hey, calm down.

803
01:06:18,191 --> 01:06:19,714
We're gonna get there.

804
01:06:19,758 --> 01:06:20,759
Yeah.

805
01:06:26,199 --> 01:06:28,332
You look very nice.

806
01:06:28,375 --> 01:06:29,724
Your hair is perfect.

807
01:06:34,164 --> 01:06:36,340
What are you doing? Stop it.

808
01:06:36,383 --> 01:06:37,384
Stop it...

809
01:06:38,429 --> 01:06:39,604
Whatever you do,

810
01:06:39,647 --> 01:06:41,388
don't speak to my sisters.
All right?

811
01:06:41,432 --> 01:06:44,043
No, I'm serious.
Don't even listen to them.

812
01:06:45,566 --> 01:06:46,804
Nice to meet you.

813
01:06:46,828 --> 01:06:48,526
Hi.

814
01:06:48,569 --> 01:06:50,745
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

815
01:06:50,789 --> 01:06:52,834
哈囉.

816
01:06:58,623 --> 01:06:59,711
This is 瑞秋.

817
01:06:59,754 --> 01:07:02,018
瑞秋, this is Roya, Nasim.

818
01:07:02,061 --> 01:07:03,778
- Shiva, my sister.
- Nice to meet you.

819
01:07:03,802 --> 01:07:05,673
This is Maryam, Farid's wife.

820
01:07:05,717 --> 01:07:07,632
Farid is my older brother.

821
01:07:07,675 --> 01:07:11,070
He is, uh... over there.

822
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:15,074
Okay, uh, I have to go
for one minute, okay?

823
01:07:15,118 --> 01:07:18,077
- Hi.
- So glad to finally meet you.

824
01:07:18,121 --> 01:07:19,339
We thought he was hiding you.

825
01:07:20,688 --> 01:07:22,212
- You are from 加拿大, right?
- Yes.

826
01:07:24,997 --> 01:07:27,217
Don't mind them,
they always do that.

827
01:07:32,526 --> 01:07:34,920
She asks if you teach
at Ali's school?

828
01:07:34,963 --> 01:07:36,835
Yes. Oh, you're Ali's mom?

829
01:07:41,796 --> 01:07:43,363
She says
that Ali told her

830
01:07:43,407 --> 01:07:45,583
that you teach him sometimes
afternoon.

831
01:07:45,626 --> 01:07:47,454
- Hm.
- So she wants to thank you.

832
01:07:49,195 --> 01:07:50,240
He's a great kid.

833
01:07:53,156 --> 01:07:55,158
You know who is that, right?

834
01:07:55,984 --> 01:07:57,029
No, should I?

835
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:58,944
Farhad's ex-wife.

836
01:07:58,987 --> 01:08:00,902
Well, I'm not surprised
she's here.

837
01:08:00,946 --> 01:08:03,557
Because her family
is friends with the groom.

838
01:08:07,213 --> 01:08:09,868
She and Farhad...
very bad divorce.

839
01:08:09,911 --> 01:08:12,000
Mm-hm, hm...

840
01:08:17,528 --> 01:08:20,487
He is asking
if she would marry him

841
01:08:20,531 --> 01:08:22,707
for 1,000 gold coins

842
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:24,535
and a truck full of flowers.

843
01:08:31,019 --> 01:08:34,980
The Meriye, it's like a gift
from the groom to the bride.

844
01:08:35,023 --> 01:08:36,218
She can ask it
whenever she wants.

845
01:08:39,985 --> 01:08:42,161
She answers
after the third time.

846
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:45,730
She says, "With the permission
of my parents

847
01:08:45,773 --> 01:08:48,211
and my grandparents... Yes."

848
01:08:56,654 --> 01:08:58,482
You didn't tell me
you were divorced.

849
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:03,008
I don't like to speak of it.

850
01:09:04,488 --> 01:09:05,924
Did you know
she was gonna be here?

851
01:09:07,752 --> 01:09:09,275
Is that why
you wanted me to come?

852
01:09:12,278 --> 01:09:13,497
I don't mind.

853
01:09:14,498 --> 01:09:16,152
I want her to know you're taken.

854
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:26,205
It's not just her, no.
It's her whole family.

855
01:09:26,249 --> 01:09:28,033
They... They don't stop
calling me.

856
01:09:28,076 --> 01:09:29,532
Are you having a good time?

857
01:09:29,556 --> 01:09:30,557
Yeah.

858
01:09:31,645 --> 01:09:33,038
Good.

859
01:09:33,081 --> 01:09:34,735
Why did you argue
with your brother?

860
01:09:36,955 --> 01:09:38,261
He's older.

861
01:09:38,304 --> 01:09:39,958
You understand.
In Iran, that matters.

862
01:09:40,001 --> 01:09:42,221
So he is, uh...

863
01:09:42,265 --> 01:09:44,832
He's in charge
of the family company and...

864
01:09:44,876 --> 01:09:47,705
He's always away.
I do all the work.

865
01:09:47,748 --> 01:09:50,273
And somehow,
still, he managed to, uh...

866
01:09:50,316 --> 01:09:53,189
- treat me like an employee.
- Hm...

867
01:09:53,232 --> 01:09:55,234
I don't want to talk about this.
Come on.

868
01:09:55,278 --> 01:09:56,951
You want something?
I get you chai,

869
01:09:56,975 --> 01:09:59,369
- gaz... I serve you. It's okay.
- No. No, really.

870
01:09:59,412 --> 01:10:00,674
I have to tell you something.

871
01:10:02,415 --> 01:10:06,071
Um, I have to fly tomorrow
to visit my father.

872
01:10:06,114 --> 01:10:07,942
You went to Europe
about three weeks ago.

873
01:10:07,986 --> 01:10:09,814
I know.
I know, but, um...

874
01:10:09,857 --> 01:10:11,772
They found some stones
in his kidney

875
01:10:11,816 --> 01:10:13,905
and, uh, he's doing
some sort of treatment.

876
01:10:13,948 --> 01:10:15,167
Why didn't you tell me?

877
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,125
I just learned.

878
01:10:17,169 --> 01:10:19,127
I think he's gonna be okay.
But, you know...

879
01:10:19,171 --> 01:10:21,129
I should go.

880
01:10:21,173 --> 01:10:23,219
You don't speak of him
very much, you know.

881
01:10:29,312 --> 01:10:31,792
You're from a good family.
You wouldn't understand.

882
01:10:41,062 --> 01:10:42,977
He's very cold, my father.

883
01:10:43,021 --> 01:10:44,240
Always has been.

884
01:10:46,067 --> 01:10:48,156
You know,
even after my mother died,

885
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,942
it was just, uh...
him and me, and...

886
01:10:51,682 --> 01:10:53,205
He was very strict.

887
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:54,380
Mm.

888
01:10:54,424 --> 01:10:56,295
Ridiculed everything I did,
you know?

889
01:10:57,949 --> 01:11:01,518
I felt like I had to lie
all the time and...

890
01:11:01,561 --> 01:11:03,694
And I would start living
in my head.

891
01:11:06,566 --> 01:11:08,133
I got so angry at one point,

892
01:11:08,176 --> 01:11:10,309
even after my mother died
that I'd...

893
01:11:10,353 --> 01:11:12,833
say, "How could you marry him?"

894
01:11:12,877 --> 01:11:15,227
You know? How could you
marry him and just...

895
01:11:16,707 --> 01:11:18,099
leave me with him.

896
01:12:24,731 --> 01:12:27,343
You're flying to Turkey
next to the Iranian border.

897
01:12:27,386 --> 01:12:28,866
My team will join.

898
01:12:28,909 --> 01:12:31,608
You're going to drive a payload
into the country.

899
01:12:32,826 --> 01:12:34,219
- Drive?
- Mm-hm.

900
01:12:34,262 --> 01:12:35,525
Through the mountains.

901
01:12:38,484 --> 01:12:39,529
What's the payload?

902
01:12:39,572 --> 01:12:40,834
Five devices.

903
01:12:41,705 --> 01:12:42,923
Flora Halles.

904
01:12:44,142 --> 01:12:45,230
German archeologist.

905
01:12:45,273 --> 01:12:46,840
Same age as you. Similar build.

906
01:12:46,884 --> 01:12:48,755
She's worked in Iran
multiple times.

907
01:12:48,799 --> 01:12:49,930
That will be your cover

908
01:12:49,974 --> 01:12:51,410
until you drop the car
in 德黑蘭.

909
01:12:52,846 --> 01:12:55,545
Driving bombs
into Iran?

910
01:12:55,588 --> 01:12:56,850
It's your job to protect me

911
01:12:56,894 --> 01:12:57,958
from things
I shouldn't be doing.

912
01:12:57,982 --> 01:12:59,418
God,
it's a simple drive

913
01:12:59,462 --> 01:13:00,680
on a route that we often use.

914
01:13:00,724 --> 01:13:01,788
It shouldn't be a big deal.

915
01:13:01,812 --> 01:13:03,291
It's a fucking huge deal!

916
01:13:03,335 --> 01:13:04,728
Because I shouldn't be
doing this.

917
01:13:04,771 --> 01:13:05,772
Hey. Hey.

918
01:13:07,426 --> 01:13:08,862
What do you want?

919
01:13:08,906 --> 01:13:09,907
You wanna leave Iran?

920
01:13:17,262 --> 01:13:18,742
You sent a woman there,

921
01:13:18,785 --> 01:13:20,526
and everything's about that.

922
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:22,441
But it's never discussed
or spoken about.

923
01:13:22,485 --> 01:13:23,486
What do you mean?

924
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:27,533
I'm pregnant, 湯瑪士.

925
01:13:33,191 --> 01:13:34,410
You have a protocol for that?

926
01:13:38,457 --> 01:13:39,676
Why didn't you say anything?

927
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:42,200
I don't want it
on their feed.

928
01:13:42,243 --> 01:13:44,376
I don't want all these
fucking people to discuss it.

929
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:49,033
I need your help, 湯瑪士.

930
01:13:49,076 --> 01:13:50,469
Quietly.

931
01:13:50,513 --> 01:13:52,447
- 瑞秋, I have to report this.
- You can't.

932
01:13:52,471 --> 01:13:53,864
They're gonna yank you.

933
01:13:53,907 --> 01:13:55,474
They're just looking
for an excuse.

934
01:13:55,518 --> 01:13:56,712
Well, so why are you
even telling me?

935
01:13:56,736 --> 01:13:59,043
Why?

936
01:13:59,086 --> 01:14:01,872
You're unbelievable.
What do you think I'm doing?

937
01:14:01,915 --> 01:14:03,613
I'm talking to you as a friend.

938
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,080
Thanks.

939
01:14:44,828 --> 01:14:46,873
So she got you
to lie for her

940
01:14:46,917 --> 01:14:48,222
and you proceeded with it?

941
01:14:48,266 --> 01:14:49,876
Ops are always doing
that sort of stuff.

942
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,419
"Prove you're on my side"
kind of thing.

943
01:14:51,443 --> 01:14:53,010
She wanted me
to transgress for her.

944
01:14:53,053 --> 01:14:54,814
- Aren't you downplaying this?
- Downplaying it?

945
01:14:54,838 --> 01:14:56,013
You know I was on a path...

946
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:58,600
I knew right then and there

947
01:14:58,624 --> 01:14:59,862
it could destroy
my whole career.

948
01:14:59,886 --> 01:15:01,061
And yet you did it.

949
01:15:01,105 --> 01:15:02,106
Yes, I did it.

950
01:15:06,589 --> 01:15:07,589
Okay.

951
01:15:11,637 --> 01:15:14,118
She had some personal stuff
to take care of.

952
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:21,734
Have you told her
we're gonna run Farhad directly?

953
01:15:21,778 --> 01:15:24,998
And do you really think that now
is a good time to tell her?

954
01:15:25,042 --> 01:15:27,697
She'll need some time
to get used to the idea.

955
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:29,568
Can you guarantee
she'll help recruit him

956
01:15:29,612 --> 01:15:31,309
once she realizes
she's on her way out?

957
01:15:31,352 --> 01:15:32,678
- Sorry...
- No need to look at him.

958
01:15:32,702 --> 01:15:34,288
Look at me. I'm gonna head
"Business as Usual"

959
01:15:34,312 --> 01:15:35,574
starting next month.

960
01:15:35,618 --> 01:15:37,271
Just don't tell anyone.

961
01:15:37,315 --> 01:15:38,621
Hasn't been announced yet.

962
01:15:44,191 --> 01:15:45,517
The decision
to pull her out

963
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,107
changed everything.

964
01:15:47,151 --> 01:15:48,500
She would never have been given

965
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,154
the Turkey Border Mission
otherwise.

966
01:15:50,197 --> 01:15:52,330
It was as if they wanted
to signal to her, to me,

967
01:15:52,373 --> 01:15:53,984
that this chapter was over.

968
01:16:04,951 --> 01:16:06,953
This is Gulal.

969
01:16:06,997 --> 01:16:10,696
He and another driver
will wait for you at this point.

970
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:12,350
It's in your GPS.

971
01:16:12,393 --> 01:16:14,657
Right here by this well.

972
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:17,660
He'd want to see
that you came alone.

973
01:16:17,703 --> 01:16:20,619
The code is,
"Archeology is good in Iran."

974
01:16:20,663 --> 01:16:22,055
Mm-hm.

975
01:16:22,099 --> 01:16:24,014
They'll drive you
through the mountains

976
01:16:24,057 --> 01:16:25,363
to the Iranian side.

977
01:16:25,406 --> 01:16:27,539
Off-road through here.

978
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,019
There's no physical borders.

979
01:16:29,062 --> 01:16:31,674
He's from a family
of Kurdish smugglers we trust.

980
01:16:33,197 --> 01:16:34,546
We timed the operation

981
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,809
so you won't intercept
the Iranian Border Patrol.

982
01:16:37,505 --> 01:16:39,507
But, if you do,

983
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:41,118
they'll deal with it.

984
01:16:41,161 --> 01:16:42,946
They'll hide you.
Bribe them.

985
01:16:42,989 --> 01:16:44,338
They do it all the time.

986
01:16:46,253 --> 01:16:47,254
All right.

987
01:16:55,045 --> 01:16:57,221
Two on this door,
three on the other.

988
01:16:58,439 --> 01:16:59,919
Do I leave the keys in the car?

989
01:16:59,963 --> 01:17:01,312
Yes.

990
01:17:01,355 --> 01:17:03,531
The people pick it up.
We'll take it from there.

991
01:17:06,012 --> 01:17:07,057
Good luck.

992
01:20:18,770 --> 01:20:19,771
Hey!

993
01:20:20,946 --> 01:20:22,034
What's your name?

994
01:20:28,475 --> 01:20:29,520
What's your name?

995
01:20:55,111 --> 01:20:56,547
Hey.

996
01:20:56,590 --> 01:20:58,220
What's your name? Hey!

997
01:20:58,244 --> 01:20:59,506
What's your name?

998
01:20:59,550 --> 01:21:01,813
- No!
- "Good at Iran."

999
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,597
"Archeology good in Iran."

1000
01:21:34,106 --> 01:21:35,238
Iran.

1001
01:21:48,425 --> 01:21:49,426
What is it?

1002
01:22:00,002 --> 01:22:01,177
What's going on?

1003
01:22:03,483 --> 01:22:04,808
Hey!

1004
01:22:12,666 --> 01:22:14,190
What's going on?

1005
01:22:14,233 --> 01:22:15,582
- Army Iran.
- Huh?

1006
01:22:15,626 --> 01:22:16,757
Army Iran.

1007
01:22:16,801 --> 01:22:17,889
Go, go, go.

1008
01:22:18,672 --> 01:22:19,673
- Go where?
- Go.

1009
01:22:22,894 --> 01:22:24,417
Go here.

1010
01:22:24,461 --> 01:22:26,004
- Go here. Go here!
- I'm not going in there.

1011
01:22:26,028 --> 01:22:27,092
I'm not going in there!

1012
01:22:27,116 --> 01:22:28,552
Go here. Army Iran.

1013
01:22:28,595 --> 01:22:30,162
Go here, go! Go here!

1014
01:22:58,495 --> 01:22:59,713
Get out.

1015
01:23:00,323 --> 01:23:02,020
Get... No!

1016
01:23:02,064 --> 01:23:03,630
No!

1017
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:05,752
Stop the car! Stop the car!

1018
01:25:05,796 --> 01:25:06,884
Stop the...

1019
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,191
Damn.

1020
01:26:46,853 --> 01:26:48,420
Fuck.

1021
01:26:51,771 --> 01:26:53,164
Fuck.

1022
01:28:20,904 --> 01:28:23,602
Was I talking in my sleep?

1023
01:28:23,646 --> 01:28:25,430
Are you giving me
sleeping pills?

1024
01:28:31,567 --> 01:28:33,220
Farhad!

1025
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:35,571
Farhad!

1026
01:28:35,614 --> 01:28:36,702
瑞秋?

1027
01:28:45,798 --> 01:28:47,234
How did this happen?

1028
01:28:48,148 --> 01:28:50,281
They don't know anything.

1029
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:53,371
A bicycle ran into me
in Germany.

1030
01:28:53,415 --> 01:28:56,069
Ugh, I didn't think
it was gonna be this bad.

1031
01:28:56,113 --> 01:28:58,376
You had some internal bleeding.

1032
01:28:58,420 --> 01:29:00,726
You're lucky
you had a Razavi card on you.

1033
01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:01,814
They called me.

1034
01:29:08,908 --> 01:29:10,997
Hm, you're going to love this.

1035
01:29:12,608 --> 01:29:14,697
How does this work?

1036
01:29:24,097 --> 01:29:25,098
What is it?

1037
01:29:26,099 --> 01:29:27,231
Bombings.

1038
01:29:28,798 --> 01:29:30,626
Iranian scientists
of the nuclear...

1039
01:29:30,669 --> 01:29:31,931
- Scientists?
- Yeah.

1040
01:29:31,975 --> 01:29:33,933
Two different locations
in 德黑蘭.

1041
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:41,985
Fuck.

1042
01:29:42,028 --> 01:29:43,378
What?

1043
01:29:43,421 --> 01:29:45,341
The scientists
were with their families.

1044
01:29:45,989 --> 01:29:47,338
Two children died.

1045
01:30:34,994 --> 01:30:36,474
What is it?

1046
01:30:36,518 --> 01:30:38,258
- You're shaking.
- This fucking hospital.

1047
01:30:38,302 --> 01:30:40,478
I can't take this anymore.

1048
01:30:41,566 --> 01:30:43,438
I hate the smell.

1049
01:30:43,481 --> 01:30:45,483
I can't...

1050
01:30:45,527 --> 01:30:47,703
I can't do this anymore.

1051
01:30:47,746 --> 01:30:49,487
Farhad...

1052
01:30:50,836 --> 01:30:52,447
This is not...

1053
01:30:52,490 --> 01:30:53,709
What's wrong?

1054
01:30:53,752 --> 01:30:55,014
I'm not...

1055
01:30:55,058 --> 01:30:56,146
This is...

1056
01:30:56,189 --> 01:30:57,364
I can't do this...

1057
01:30:57,408 --> 01:31:00,063
I can't do this anymore.

1058
01:31:05,503 --> 01:31:06,939
What, what, what?

1059
01:31:06,983 --> 01:31:08,114
What is it?

1060
01:31:09,725 --> 01:31:11,074
What is it?

1061
01:32:17,444 --> 01:32:18,794
How is your father?

1062
01:32:21,579 --> 01:32:22,754
He's fine.

1063
01:32:22,798 --> 01:32:23,929
Yeah, much better.

1064
01:32:25,583 --> 01:32:27,411
When is the next time
you'll visit him?

1065
01:32:29,979 --> 01:32:31,371
Don't know. A few weeks.

1066
01:32:31,807 --> 01:32:32,808
Why?

1067
01:32:34,984 --> 01:32:37,595
We are constantly
getting offers now

1068
01:32:37,639 --> 01:32:39,423
to expand our business

1069
01:32:39,466 --> 01:32:41,556
from Belgium, Germany.

1070
01:32:43,688 --> 01:32:47,083
But, my brother,
he doesn't like the risk

1071
01:32:47,126 --> 01:32:49,389
because of the sanctions.

1072
01:32:49,433 --> 01:32:50,956
But these sanctions,
they're even on

1073
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,132
chips you need
in a goddamn toaster oven.

1074
01:32:55,395 --> 01:32:58,398
The world
is so hypocrite about this.

1075
01:32:58,442 --> 01:33:01,880
It's okay for 以色列 and America
to blow up children,

1076
01:33:01,924 --> 01:33:04,927
but we can't have
the components for, uh...

1077
01:33:04,970 --> 01:33:06,363
medical equipment.

1078
01:33:09,148 --> 01:33:10,236
You can help me.

1079
01:33:11,847 --> 01:33:12,848
Me?

1080
01:33:16,547 --> 01:33:18,027
Next time you're in Europe,

1081
01:33:18,984 --> 01:33:21,073
pick up some things for us.

1082
01:33:21,117 --> 01:33:22,858
- Farhad...
- No, no, no.

1083
01:33:22,901 --> 01:33:25,164
Computer chips.

1084
01:33:25,208 --> 01:33:27,906
They, they look at you,
Australian passport,

1085
01:33:27,950 --> 01:33:29,647
they're not gonna bother you.

1086
01:33:31,562 --> 01:33:33,608
Please don't ask me to do this.

1087
01:33:33,651 --> 01:33:35,610
Nobody will stop you.

1088
01:33:35,653 --> 01:33:37,655
And, if they do,
we deal with it.

1089
01:33:37,699 --> 01:33:39,396
I'm not worried about me.

1090
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:46,621
I don't think
you should get into this.

1091
01:33:46,664 --> 01:33:47,665
Don't you trust me

1092
01:33:47,709 --> 01:33:49,275
when I tell you
something is okay?

1093
01:33:53,715 --> 01:33:55,151
I tell you...

1094
01:33:56,239 --> 01:33:57,501
It is okay.

1095
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:39,021
Okay.

1096
01:34:45,331 --> 01:34:46,768
The laptop you brought

1097
01:34:46,811 --> 01:34:48,944
houses 20 logic controllers

1098
01:34:48,987 --> 01:34:51,860
with our version
of the STEP 7 Software.

1099
01:34:51,903 --> 01:34:54,079
We started circulating them
in the black market

1100
01:34:54,123 --> 01:34:56,299
since February.

1101
01:34:56,342 --> 01:34:57,902
What's the story
he's telling you?

1102
01:34:59,781 --> 01:35:01,217
That it's for medical equipment.

1103
01:35:01,913 --> 01:35:03,045
Good.

1104
01:35:06,788 --> 01:35:08,311
So he's in the business now.

1105
01:35:10,095 --> 01:35:12,184
You need to find a way
to bring him here.

1106
01:35:12,968 --> 01:35:14,491
Here? To 萊比錫?

1107
01:35:15,971 --> 01:35:17,059
Why?

1108
01:35:18,321 --> 01:35:19,975
I mean, why would he?

1109
01:35:20,018 --> 01:35:21,063
The whole point is that

1110
01:35:21,106 --> 01:35:22,426
I carry that stuff
for him, right?

1111
01:35:25,676 --> 01:35:27,417
He's not cut out for this.

1112
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:29,245
He's like a kid
trying to prove himself.

1113
01:35:29,288 --> 01:35:30,333
He's already used you

1114
01:35:30,376 --> 01:35:31,987
to smuggle
restricted technology.

1115
01:35:32,030 --> 01:35:33,728
Because we seduced him into it

1116
01:35:33,771 --> 01:35:35,555
with all these offers
from our companies.

1117
01:35:36,556 --> 01:35:37,601
Whatever, 湯瑪士.

1118
01:35:37,644 --> 01:35:39,124
Are you pulling me out?

1119
01:35:39,168 --> 01:35:40,343
No.

1120
01:35:45,609 --> 01:35:47,132
Are you pulling me out?

1121
01:35:47,176 --> 01:35:48,960
No.

1122
01:35:49,004 --> 01:35:50,875
We're gonna approach him
as a German company

1123
01:35:50,919 --> 01:35:54,052
seeking to do business
with Razavi Electronics.

1124
01:35:55,053 --> 01:35:56,359
When he lands,

1125
01:35:56,402 --> 01:35:58,032
I want you to take him
to a French restaurant

1126
01:35:58,056 --> 01:35:59,492
called, "Chez Henriette."

1127
01:35:59,536 --> 01:36:01,059
Eat. Someone will join you.

1128
01:36:01,103 --> 01:36:03,018
Who? You?

1129
01:36:03,061 --> 01:36:05,194
You always wanted
to get your hands on him.

1130
01:36:05,237 --> 01:36:06,737
But you got your hands on him.

1131
01:36:06,761 --> 01:36:08,545
- See how that worked out.
- Fuck you.

1132
01:36:31,133 --> 01:36:32,264
Suits you.

1133
01:36:34,049 --> 01:36:35,093
You like it?

1134
01:36:47,062 --> 01:36:48,150
Made a reservation

1135
01:36:48,193 --> 01:36:51,414
at my favorite French restaurant
in town.

1136
01:36:51,457 --> 01:36:53,590
I ate on the train.
I'm not hungry now.

1137
01:36:56,636 --> 01:36:57,942
Okay...

1138
01:36:57,986 --> 01:37:00,292
Well, I'm hungry.
Are you gonna come with me?

1139
01:37:08,083 --> 01:37:09,475
What is it, Farhad?

1140
01:37:12,217 --> 01:37:15,264
Did you go to an abortion place
in 德黑蘭 last month?

1141
01:37:17,005 --> 01:37:18,833
I...

1142
01:37:22,837 --> 01:37:23,838
I did.

1143
01:37:26,144 --> 01:37:28,407
I'm sorry.
I should've told you, all right?

1144
01:37:29,365 --> 01:37:30,627
My period was late.

1145
01:37:30,670 --> 01:37:32,759
I freaked out.
I just went to some place and...

1146
01:37:34,544 --> 01:37:36,087
I wouldn't have done anything
without you.

1147
01:37:36,111 --> 01:37:37,199
I got scared.

1148
01:37:37,242 --> 01:37:38,654
And then my period came
the next day,

1149
01:37:38,678 --> 01:37:39,679
it was false alarm.

1150
01:37:39,723 --> 01:37:41,116
So you're going
to get rid of this

1151
01:37:41,159 --> 01:37:42,682
without me ever knowing.

1152
01:37:42,726 --> 01:37:43,988
No.

1153
01:37:44,032 --> 01:37:45,294
Of course not.

1154
01:37:47,426 --> 01:37:50,429
I can never tell
what is going on behind your...

1155
01:37:52,692 --> 01:37:54,781
I'm not pregnant.

1156
01:37:54,825 --> 01:37:56,827
I was never pregnant, all right?

1157
01:37:56,871 --> 01:37:58,263
We're all hiding stuff.

1158
01:37:58,307 --> 01:37:59,656
You too.

1159
01:37:59,699 --> 01:38:01,590
What do you mean "you too"?

1160
01:38:01,614 --> 01:38:03,921
- Now, who's wearing...
- What do you mean "you too"?

1161
01:38:03,965 --> 01:38:05,792
Farhad, I live in a country

1162
01:38:05,836 --> 01:38:07,422
where I don't speak
the language, all right?

1163
01:38:07,446 --> 01:38:08,839
And the only person I know
is you.

1164
01:38:08,883 --> 01:38:10,077
What do you think
that feels like?

1165
01:38:10,101 --> 01:38:11,929
- 哈囉?
- Your father died.

1166
01:38:11,973 --> 01:38:13,888
What?

1167
01:38:13,931 --> 01:38:16,281
- No, we're going to...
- You heard what I said.

1168
01:38:16,325 --> 01:38:17,717
But we're going for lunch.

1169
01:38:17,761 --> 01:38:19,937
Exit now.
We're on our way up.

1170
01:38:19,981 --> 01:38:20,981
What is it?

1171
01:38:23,201 --> 01:38:25,116
What is it?

1172
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:27,510
Farhad, I... I have to make
a phone call.

1173
01:38:27,553 --> 01:38:29,381
My father...

1174
01:38:29,425 --> 01:38:30,948
Just wait for me here,
all right?

1175
01:38:30,992 --> 01:38:32,428
I'll... I'll be right back.

1176
01:38:40,262 --> 01:38:41,524
Son of a bitch.

1177
01:38:43,265 --> 01:38:44,614
瑞秋.

1178
01:38:44,657 --> 01:38:47,008
Hey, what are you...

1179
01:38:55,103 --> 01:38:56,626
English?

1180
01:38:56,669 --> 01:38:58,628
You're involved in a plot
to carry items

1181
01:38:58,671 --> 01:39:01,413
that violate the sanctions
against Iran.

1182
01:39:01,457 --> 01:39:03,391
Your lady friend is going
to appear before a judge

1183
01:39:03,415 --> 01:39:04,677
and go to jail.

1184
01:39:04,721 --> 01:39:06,375
So will you.

1185
01:39:06,418 --> 01:39:08,681
We will also implicate
your company.

1186
01:39:08,725 --> 01:39:10,596
What happens from now on,

1187
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:12,076
it's really all up to you.

1188
01:39:20,693 --> 01:39:23,392
Did you try to terminate
a pregnancy in 德黑蘭?

1189
01:39:27,091 --> 01:39:28,788
Did 湯瑪士 know about this?

1190
01:39:56,642 --> 01:39:58,383
I answered
this question already.

1191
01:40:01,343 --> 01:40:03,432
I did, yes.
But she refused to talk to me.

1192
01:40:03,475 --> 01:40:04,626
Why did you call her?

1193
01:40:04,650 --> 01:40:06,043
I wanted to see how she's doing.

1194
01:40:06,087 --> 01:40:08,480
Helping her conceal
her pregnancy ended your career.

1195
01:40:08,524 --> 01:40:10,047
- Weren't you angry?
- What? With her?

1196
01:40:11,527 --> 01:40:12,765
Because I was very involved
in her life.

1197
01:40:12,789 --> 01:40:14,182
You stopped giving a shit.

1198
01:40:14,225 --> 01:40:15,855
You threw her away.
You choose she's no use anymore.

1199
01:40:15,879 --> 01:40:17,402
Oh, so now it's our fault.

1200
01:40:19,491 --> 01:40:21,363
What did she do
in her year in 以色列?

1201
01:40:25,236 --> 01:40:26,344
Probably trying
to contact Farhad

1202
01:40:26,368 --> 01:40:27,432
or get information about him.

1203
01:40:27,456 --> 01:40:28,892
Farhad is not in 德黑蘭 anymore.

1204
01:40:28,935 --> 01:40:30,459
Look at this.

1205
01:40:30,502 --> 01:40:31,958
After burying her father,
she gave an interview to this...

1206
01:40:31,982 --> 01:40:33,177
I don't know, local town paper.

1207
01:40:33,201 --> 01:40:35,159
She got her picture
in the fucking paper.

1208
01:40:35,203 --> 01:40:36,421
This is two days ago.

1209
01:40:36,465 --> 01:40:38,423
She also filed for a taxpayer ID
in England.

1210
01:40:38,467 --> 01:40:40,164
She's upping
her British identity profile.

1211
01:40:40,208 --> 01:40:41,272
Why would she do that?

1212
01:40:41,296 --> 01:40:42,993
- Isn't it obvious?
- No!

1213
01:40:43,037 --> 01:40:45,058
To make it harder for you
to fuck with her on European soil.

1214
01:41:27,385 --> 01:41:29,474
Farhad is still part
of "Business as Usual."

1215
01:41:29,518 --> 01:41:30,649
He lives in Germany.

1216
01:41:30,693 --> 01:41:31,737
We're running false flag.

1217
01:41:31,781 --> 01:41:33,019
He thinks he works
for the Germans.

1218
01:41:33,043 --> 01:41:34,175
Did you know that?

1219
01:41:34,218 --> 01:41:35,350
No.

1220
01:41:35,393 --> 01:41:36,699
Is she trying to meet him?

1221
01:41:36,742 --> 01:41:37,787
Seems so.

1222
01:41:38,701 --> 01:41:40,181
But there's much more going on.

1223
01:41:45,142 --> 01:41:46,250
She spent a day
in Switzerland

1224
01:41:46,274 --> 01:41:47,318
after leaving 倫敦.

1225
01:41:47,362 --> 01:41:48,624
Which passport is she using?

1226
01:41:48,667 --> 01:41:49,712
Her real one.

1227
01:41:49,755 --> 01:41:50,887
How did she leave 以色列

1228
01:41:50,930 --> 01:41:52,256
without getting flagged
at the airport?

1229
01:42:14,998 --> 01:42:16,391
We're not there yet.

1230
01:42:16,434 --> 01:42:17,803
She's threatening
the entire operation.

1231
01:42:17,827 --> 01:42:18,915
We have no choice.

1232
01:42:18,958 --> 01:42:20,327
After all she has done for us?

1233
01:42:20,351 --> 01:42:21,570
She's an operative.

1234
01:42:21,613 --> 01:42:23,113
She's not just some asset
you can discard.

1235
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:24,636
We're trying
to make contact with her.

1236
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:26,028
Once we do,
we'll put you on the phone...

1237
01:42:26,052 --> 01:42:27,402
No, no, no. Please...

1238
01:42:27,445 --> 01:42:29,621
Let me be the first one
to make contact with her.

1239
01:42:29,665 --> 01:42:30,772
I'll talk her out of Germany.

1240
01:42:30,796 --> 01:42:32,146
But face-to-face.

1241
01:42:32,189 --> 01:42:33,843
I'll get her out.
No shots fired,

1242
01:42:33,886 --> 01:42:35,323
no mess to clean up.

1243
01:42:56,605 --> 01:42:58,259
So...

1244
01:42:58,302 --> 01:43:00,086
They think
if they send you, you...

1245
01:43:00,130 --> 01:43:02,219
can convince me
to recruit my brother?

1246
01:43:05,135 --> 01:43:06,180
Is that what they're...

1247
01:43:07,616 --> 01:43:08,617
No.

1248
01:43:09,531 --> 01:43:10,793
I'm not with them anymore.

1249
01:43:11,489 --> 01:43:12,534
You don't.

1250
01:43:13,796 --> 01:43:15,363
- No.
- How did you find me?

1251
01:43:17,669 --> 01:43:19,105
It took a really long time.

1252
01:43:28,767 --> 01:43:31,161
- I'm sorry.
- Stop, please.

1253
01:43:32,162 --> 01:43:33,511
I made my own mess.

1254
01:43:34,338 --> 01:43:35,774
I was too eager.

1255
01:43:38,951 --> 01:43:40,736
You know, in the beginning, I...

1256
01:43:40,779 --> 01:43:42,172
I was sure that...

1257
01:43:43,042 --> 01:43:45,306
I brought trouble to you.

1258
01:43:45,349 --> 01:43:47,656
You disappeared,
they told me you were in jail

1259
01:43:47,699 --> 01:43:49,266
because of the things
you brought back

1260
01:43:49,310 --> 01:43:50,702
that I told you to bring.

1261
01:43:51,921 --> 01:43:54,489
I tried to make a deal with them

1262
01:43:55,316 --> 01:43:56,491
to release you.

1263
01:43:59,189 --> 01:44:01,887
Only after many months,
I realized...

1264
01:44:01,931 --> 01:44:03,149
you were with them.

1265
01:44:06,501 --> 01:44:07,782
Everything that was between us

1266
01:44:07,806 --> 01:44:08,807
was for them?

1267
01:44:11,984 --> 01:44:13,508
Everything was a lie?

1268
01:44:20,341 --> 01:44:21,559
What do you want?

1269
01:44:33,310 --> 01:44:34,746
I came here to see you.

1270
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:38,272
And I came here
to say I'm sorry.

1271
01:44:42,667 --> 01:44:45,061
I came here to try
and get you out of this.

1272
01:45:04,123 --> 01:45:05,734
Keep the phone
on the table.

1273
01:45:05,777 --> 01:45:08,563
The solution you're offering
is the only solution.

1274
01:45:08,606 --> 01:45:10,956
You came for her.
It's the truth. Use it.

1275
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,306
I know, 喬. I will.

1276
01:45:50,779 --> 01:45:52,346
I'm sorry to hear
about your father.

1277
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:02,965
Do you remember how angry
I got once when you called him?

1278
01:46:03,008 --> 01:46:04,967
Truth is
it really made me laugh.

1279
01:46:05,010 --> 01:46:06,055
Why?

1280
01:46:07,056 --> 01:46:08,797
He was such a...

1281
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:10,407
British liberal.

1282
01:46:10,451 --> 01:46:13,149
You know, stuffy historian.

1283
01:46:13,192 --> 01:46:16,544
Hated 以色列. The idea of it.

1284
01:46:16,587 --> 01:46:18,720
I can just imagine
what his reaction was like.

1285
01:46:18,763 --> 01:46:20,025
He was pretty scary.

1286
01:46:24,552 --> 01:46:25,944
What do you want, 瑞秋?

1287
01:46:26,641 --> 01:46:27,946
My name is Ann.

1288
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:32,298
What do you want, Ann?

1289
01:46:35,258 --> 01:46:37,129
湯瑪士, I called you yesterday

1290
01:46:37,173 --> 01:46:39,436
because I knew
they would pull you into this.

1291
01:46:41,177 --> 01:46:42,439
I'm really glad you're here.

1292
01:46:45,181 --> 01:46:47,096
I went to Switzerland.

1293
01:46:47,139 --> 01:46:48,619
I set up safe deposit boxes

1294
01:46:48,663 --> 01:46:52,188
with information
about "Business as Usual."

1295
01:46:52,231 --> 01:46:54,930
They're paid in advance
for one month only.

1296
01:46:56,932 --> 01:46:59,238
Here's proof
if they need it.

1297
01:46:59,282 --> 01:47:01,042
If they're not paid
by the end of the month...

1298
01:47:03,286 --> 01:47:05,070
The content will be made public.

1299
01:47:06,550 --> 01:47:08,639
I want out, 湯瑪士.

1300
01:47:08,683 --> 01:47:10,467
I don't wanna work
for them anymore.

1301
01:47:10,511 --> 01:47:13,644
I didn't wanna report to them
or do annual polygraphs.

1302
01:47:13,688 --> 01:47:15,907
I'm done.

1303
01:47:15,951 --> 01:47:19,520
And I want you to help me
negotiate Farhad's freedom.

1304
01:47:19,563 --> 01:47:21,696
Extricate him
step-by-step.

1305
01:47:21,739 --> 01:47:23,219
And I'll only follow up
with you.

1306
01:47:24,350 --> 01:47:25,787
Once that's done,

1307
01:47:25,830 --> 01:47:28,006
I'll give you the bank details
and the safe numbers.

1308
01:47:30,095 --> 01:47:31,706
Listen, you know
I have no interest

1309
01:47:31,749 --> 01:47:33,490
in exposing any
of this information.

1310
01:47:33,534 --> 01:47:34,622
Make them understand.

1311
01:47:34,665 --> 01:47:35,971
You're running around Germany,

1312
01:47:36,014 --> 01:47:39,409
assuming that they won't act
on European soil.

1313
01:47:39,453 --> 01:47:40,932
Well, you're wrong.

1314
01:47:40,976 --> 01:47:42,170
They're getting desperate.

1315
01:47:42,194 --> 01:47:43,892
You're an outsider,
you're a foreigner.

1316
01:47:43,935 --> 01:47:45,850
You're not really 以色列i
or really Jewish.

1317
01:47:45,894 --> 01:47:47,330
Got no formal tie.

1318
01:47:47,373 --> 01:47:49,114
To them,
you're just a British citizen

1319
01:47:49,158 --> 01:47:50,798
who's suddenly gonna drop dead
in 科隆.

1320
01:47:52,074 --> 01:47:53,379
I haven't so far.

1321
01:47:53,423 --> 01:47:55,469
Then they're waiting for me
to talk you out.

1322
01:48:00,778 --> 01:48:01,997
They won't dare.

1323
01:48:03,259 --> 01:48:04,521
They'll negotiate.

1324
01:48:06,044 --> 01:48:08,612
They'll hit you,
and no one will ever know.

1325
01:48:09,700 --> 01:48:10,745
You'll know.

1326
01:48:18,492 --> 01:48:21,582
Look, 湯瑪士. All my life,
I've done things thinking...

1327
01:48:24,019 --> 01:48:25,411
I just feel like

1328
01:48:25,455 --> 01:48:28,458
I've never really made
a decision that's just mine.

1329
01:48:28,502 --> 01:48:29,590
And this is it.

1330
01:48:29,633 --> 01:48:31,374
This is my decision.

1331
01:48:32,854 --> 01:48:33,985
Even if I'm gonna get shot

1332
01:48:34,029 --> 01:48:35,944
in the next five minutes,

1333
01:48:35,987 --> 01:48:37,249
I still did this.

1334
01:48:54,702 --> 01:48:56,225
Mm-hmm?

1335
01:48:56,268 --> 01:48:57,855
Don't let her leave the table. Make the offer.

1336
01:48:57,879 --> 01:48:59,707
If she walks,
we'll be forced to act.

1337
01:48:59,750 --> 01:49:01,578
Put the phone down.

1338
01:49:01,622 --> 01:49:02,642
- They know the deal.
- 湯瑪士,

1339
01:49:02,666 --> 01:49:04,363
don't let her walk.

1340
01:49:04,407 --> 01:49:05,408
They're here for me.

1341
01:49:27,648 --> 01:49:29,234
湯瑪士,
what the hell are you doing?

1342
01:49:29,258 --> 01:49:30,825
Get out of the way right now!

1343
01:49:58,679 --> 01:50:00,071
Run!
